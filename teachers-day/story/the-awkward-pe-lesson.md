# The awkward (really awkward) PE lesson

Never have I expected this to happen during pe lesson lol 🤣🤣

It was a sunny day (so *cliche*). The class was having Chinese lesson. When the bell rang, suddenly, Regina (you can ask me not to use ur name) told Mdm Sim “现在是PE了！” The whole class started laughing and Mdm Sim asked, "Are you scared of Ms Lee?" We didn't reply but I bet that we were all thinking "of course lol she is assistant year head"

We quickly changed **(ahem ahem)** quickly and then rushed **(ahem ahem)** to the parade square.

To our surprise, we did not see Ms Lee waiting for us there. Instead, she led us to the open space outside the library. She asked us to sit in register number order and then told us "We will be doing some simple stretching here today!"

*(Me being like umm with all the people looking at us? Ok...?)*

And we started our stretching. Ms Lee told us to count to 10 and asked us to count in other languages (Like Japanese and Chinese etc.). After a while, Ms Lee suddenly said something that made us really freaked out (or just made things really awkward).

"Now, let me count in my cute voice!!" Ms Lee said.

When our class heard that, we felt even more embarrassed (sorry 😅😅) and had to stretch our muscles. After that few seconds, she asked us to count in our own cute voice. We actually did not want to stretch with our "cute" voice as it was really really *really* embarrasing... but we still had to do t anyway if not Ms Lee would hold us back from recess.

So, after that, Ms Lee asked us to count with our sexy (?!) voice and our cartoon voice. We felt really awkward but at least that we shamed ourselves together! 🤩🤩 The students from other classes who walked past would also look at us with a wierd expression. Mdm Loh also stretched with us, and we had a lot (?) of fun!

Soon, we had to do jumping jacks (I'm not really going to talk about this that much) we had to do it many many times cos we were not in sync but we were still let off for recess. Ms Lee said that her standards were that everyone has to be in sync when doing the jumping jacks and counting.

We went off for recess and felt that it was one of the most awkward lessons ever! 

*Omake*

No omake sorry!
